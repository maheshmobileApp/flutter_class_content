Dart function is a set of statements to perform a specific task.

a = 10;

b = 20;

 z = a + b;


1. re-usability of the program
2. it optimizes the code
3. it makes developmet easy and creates less complexity

//syntax
int
returntype functionNamess(parameterlist) {



    return 0;

}

returnType: it can be any data type such as void, integer,string.......the return type must be matched with the returned value of the function.
functionname: it should be an appropriate valid identifier

parameterlist: list of the parameters, which is necessary when we called a function.
